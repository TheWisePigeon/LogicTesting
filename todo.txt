create a constant as the total supply
implement a basic user registration:
    ask for mail, username and password
    create a JSON with these keys:
        -username
        -mail
        -password
        -refLink(has to be unic)
        -balance
    initialize balance at 2000 and decrease the total supply automatically
ask the user for a refLink if he has been invited
log the user that refeered him
increase that user's balance by 500
